    "# Project 1 - Closing Price Stock Regressor - Version 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "    Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook attempts (keyword, attempts) to predict the daily closing price of an inputted stock ticker, given its historical data, some added features through feature engineering, and the current day's opening price. I am going to do my best to explain each detail so that anyone (newbie or professional) can follow along. This model as it stands right now is not very good at predicting the closing price, but that isn't really my intent with this project, but more just to display what I've learned so far, and for others to get started as well if they're interested in a skeleton project to get started. There's always room for improvement but I'm hoping that this will help get someone started on their way if they are looking to get into the field of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Day traders typically start their mornings by creating a 'watchlist' of stocks before the market's opening bell. The theory behind this project is that, if you know (roughly) where a stock is about to open today pre-market, and have some of its previous days historical data, you might be able to train a regression model to gauge a better idea of where the stock will close that day, giving actionable insight into whether to buy the stock or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is only meant to act as a demonstration of some of my Python programming and machine learning knowledge to date (August, 2019 as of this writing). Everything I've compiled in this project I have pieced together from various sources and it's all things that I have learned from my own research and self-teaching. I have many years of technical analysis knowledge of the stock and Forex markets, but I do not have a degree in Computer Science or any formal education in the field (which may or may not become evident to whomever is reading this). I welcome advice and criticisms to make things more efficient and better so that I can develop as a programmer. If you see anything I've missed the point on, please let me know. I have spent a fair amount of time commenting each section of code to make it easy for a newbie coder to read along and understand what's happening. Experienced coders will be able to just look at each code section and see what's going on, so skim or read, the choice is yours. This should also help to isolate a section in case someone runs into an issue, they will be able to point to where it happened. \n",

    "    DISCLAIMER: This project is merely a compilation of various Python and machine learning skills that I have picked up \n",
    "    over the past few months and years, and acting as a test for me to see if I'm able to CLEARLY explain the various \n",
    "    details and tools used throughout the project so that maybe one day I can show a potential employer my skillset and \n",
    "    secure a job in this field. This tool is not actually meant to be used for stock advisement, it is for academic\n",

    "First, we downloaded daily historical stock data for an inputted stock, then scraped Yahoo Finance's website for Industry titles and subsequently downloaded its historical data as well. We then used Pandas to maniuplate the dataframe and add a couple of moving averages to the dataset. From there, we utilized automatic feature engineering and selection to find new, hidden relationships within our data, giving us insight into the data which we may or may not know anything about. We then passed that new dataset to an automatic machine learning module that optimized for the best regression pipeline with the highest predictive power we could find. Pat yourself on the back! This is some new-aged stuff you're doing here.\n",

    "So looking at the results of the training/testing of our model, we see that our final model can predict the closing price of a stock to within an average of $3.54 (MSE), with an R2 value of 0.99, which suggests that our model almost perfectly explains the variance in our data. Now two things to keep in mind here:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. With such a high R2, would this suggest that we overfitted our model to the training data? Well, we would have to try it out on some new, unseen data to get a final verdict on its power (which we're about to do).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Is predicting the closing price to within $3.54 average good enough for the data? Well that depends. If we were trying to predict the closing price of say, AMZN, which as of this writing is trading around the $1,775 - $2,000 mark, that would be an awesome prediction. If we are using a lower priced stock, like CLVS which is around $5 - $10, it's probably not the greatest. The point is, it all depends on the data you're using, and that's a decision you'll have to make for yourself. I will touch on possible ways to (potentially) improve this model later."

The predicted values were well above the actual closing price for many days.

As previously discussed, the performance of this model was not the point of this repository, but rather my chance to showcase my programming knowledge thus far, and to clearly explain some of the concepts within as a personal challenge to myself. I hope you learned how to implement some of these operations yourself if you're a newbie. I really appreciated projects like this when I was getting started. Some of my future projects may not be this well documented, unless I'm introducing a new concept.\n",

I will do this using TPOT/SkLearn as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future I'm going to recreate this project using Tensorflow to familiarize myself with that module using both Regression and Classification there as well. Then my next big project after that will be to learn how to setup a custom OpenAI Gym stock trading environment where I can get to know how to utilize Reinforcement Learning algorithms in a simulated live trading environment. So stay tuned for all of that."
